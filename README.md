MNIST GAN with PyTorch

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to generate handwritten digit images similar to those found in the MNIST dataset.

Overview

The GAN is composed of two models:
	•	Generator: Learns to generate realistic digit images from random noise.
	•	Discriminator: Learns to distinguish real MNIST images from fake ones generated by the generator.

The two models are trained in an adversarial setup where the generator tries to fool the discriminator.

Features
	•	Built using PyTorch
	•	Trains on the MNIST dataset
	•	Saves generated images after each epoch
	•	Outputs training progression and sample generations

Requirements
	•	Python 3.x
	•	PyTorch
	•	torchvision
	•	matplotlib

Install dependencies via:

pip install torch torchvision matplotlib

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Run the script:

python hw5.py


	3.	Check the gan_images/ folder for generated outputs after each epoch.

Training Details
	•	Epochs: 101
	•	Batch Size: 64
	•	Latent Dimension: 100
	•	Optimizer: Adam
	•	Learning Rate: 0.0002

Output

Each epoch saves a grid of 25 generated digit images to gan_images/epoch_{n}.png.
